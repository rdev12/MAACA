176,136,Phone,iPhone XS & XS Max ,iPhone XS & XS Max Review with Pros & Cons after a Month of Usage,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0gcnH9KpC8,8:06-8:48,os,0.0, Now let's move to the console again I have a huge list let's go over them and the first  thing I still don't like on both of these iPhones is the autobrightness sensor.  I never liked the autobrightness sensor on earlier generations of the iPhone and that's  the same case even with these one and most of the time I have to actually go over here  and manually adjust the brightness.  I don't know the bright auto brightness sensor is simply not that sensitive on these phones  and in fact it's the same case even with the iPhone XR so I don't know why but yeah it's  the same case.  The autobrightness sensor is technically but again I don't feel it does a very good job  and many times I have to manually adjust the brightness especially at night when I'm reading
7,99,Phone,iQOO 11,iQOO 11 Review with Pros & Cons | Specs on Paper,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hUHgf8Hoy0,10:31-15:49,camera,0.0," to this one regarding the camera samples as you've saw most outdoor shots it does  create but when it comes to dynamic range I feel the dynamic range is also very very poor  on this smartphone in fact this is my daughter's S20 FE and notice how well it did in shadowed  areas compared to this smartphone so I feel in terms of camera also they are holding back  because generally again I go is nothing but a vivo subsidiary Vivo does very good in camera  so I was having far more what do you say expectations considering the ISP that is there on the  Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is among the best so frankly in terms of camera I would say again the camera  performance is okay but again in challenging situations it just falls apart also coming  to the ultra wide I don't get it on a flagship 8 megapixel yes the good thing is that in  outdoor shots at least there is no major color difference comparing it from the primary  50 megapixel camera but when the lighting is a little bit low and challenging situation  it just falls apart another thing is regarding the front facing camera those are 16 megapixel  for some reason again Ico has limited the video recording to just 1080p they don't get  4K again the processor has enough power so that you can even shoot 4K but I don't know  why they have restricted it so some of these decisions what Ico has done are like perplexing  now coming to another thing that I do not like with this smartphone is that this smartphone  the base unit is also priced at about 60,000 with card discount you can get it for 55 but  even at this price point there is no IP production I'm not expecting IP 68 or something but some  sort of IP production should have been there considering the price fund but that is also  not there on this smartphone next thing is that again this is a plaguing almost every  Android smartphone so I won't be specific to this but again the half-tech motor feedback  is again very very average I would say again you notice that start ring and lack that's  what I was talking within the UI you see that so half-tech feedback is there don't get  me wrong but again it's not done and that well in my friend copy next thing is again considering  the price point it does have all these apps are actually bloatware guys and it also has  this hot games and all this I didn't enable I greeted it will show that so there is quite  a bit of bloatware that is present on this smartphone again that's not a good thing again  considering the price point I expect yes Ico smartphones in the midrange or the premium  midrange having bloatware but this is a smartphone that is costing 60,000 and you have bloatware  and many of the bloatware for example their custom app or something keeps sending a notifications  over here to install this app or that up yes you can disable it but at this price point  you're touting this as the fastest flagship smartphone or whatever having bloatware is not  a good idea in my frank opinion coming down to the pricing of this smartphone because this  was one of the first smartphone with the Snapdragon 8.2 chipset I don't know how the other  smartphones will be priced for example we know that the OnePlus 11 will be coming out  in February with the Snapdragon 8.2 so we know what is the app pricing so I just don't  want to comment too much but again Icoop as a brand Icoop cut itself because of the  aggressive price points but now at this this smartphone for the price point of even  with a discount if you talk 55,000 I feel it's priced a little bit higher because of the  compromises that I've mentioned and also it has bloatware so certainly Icoop needs to  relook at their smartphones that they're launching in India and just do launch one smartphone  after the other if you're launching your smartphone spend a little bit time and optimize  the software that is present on the smartphone it doesn't matter you might be having the fastest  processor available but let's say you're not able to take the advantage of the processor  or use just about 40% of the performance of that what's the use in my frank opinion so  I feel Ico as a brand really needs to rethink about the positioning of this smartphone the  pricing the features what they're offering and also they have to start optimizing their smartphone  they just can't play on this specs and keep selling their smartphone that's my frank opinion  so I hope Icoop improves that with the future what he said launches and go slow down slow  down a little bit pay attention optimize the software for example see what nothing did nothing  with their smartphone with updates they improved it so much but if this phone which is a Snapdragon  778 feels a little bit more fluid and operations compared to this smartphone then I don't know  what is wrong with the industry I know the Ico team might not like what I posted with my  review but these are the facts and I thought somebody in the industry has to tell the  fact so that the brand wakes up and takes that into attention and I feel other YouTubers  just doing the unboxing and just praising stuff start testing the phone and start using  the phone and then only share their experience anyways guys that's it for now for this review  thanks for watching this is Ranji and I hope to see you in my next video take care guys"

And now it is just about 2 weeks since I have been using this device.  And in general usage the phone has been working fine and as of now I have not noticed any  lag and most of the time it is very fluid as you can see I do not even close the apps  that are in the memory and stuff.  General performance is good.

",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpl2JjLvzg,1:30-1:49,design,1.0," But let's talk about the pros now.  And the first thing that I liked about this smartphone is the design, I would say.  And it feels actually sleek in the hand.  The in-hand feel is good.  It's neither too heavy nor light.  It weighs 177 grams.  So I feel they have done a good job in terms of build."

This was not the issue prior to the software update now, it's working perfectly fine as  you can see.  But I feel it has slowed down a little bit.  Hopefully, Samsung does fix this with the next OTA update."

Now moving to the speaker.  This one has just a single speaker and that speaker is on the earpiece.  I would say it gets the job done but most of the time when I was using this phone I was  keeping the volume level at max and I always felt that it should have one or two levels  more of loudness.  So that is one thing that I did not like and I frankly feel Motorola should have implemented

Moving to the processor, this is having the Snapdragon 732 SOC.  And even the G40 is the same guys.  I'll leave the specs list here so that you can get a better idea.  And I would say it hinders this smartphone very well."

206,143,Phone,Samsung Galaxy Note 9 ,Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Review with Pros & Cons - Almost Perfect?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Shy5MGHiBp4,6:00-7:07,battery,1.0," But again, all the functionality of the S Pen is still there on this device.  Now moving to the battery life, this is a huge improvement.  I would say it has a 4000 milli amp hour battery.  And when I tested the Galaxy S8 last year, my biggest gripe was the battery life because  end of the typical day, it used to just come down to around 10 or 12 percent and that used  to make me very, very nervous with this Note 9.  Thankfully, that's not the case.  And guys, I'm testing this Note 9.  I've changed the screen resolution.  Before it comes at full HD, but I'm testing it one with the Quad HD plus and I've also  enabled this always screen on time.  Hence if you just keep it on full HD and disable this on screen on time, your mileage will  be even better.  But even with this setting, it was easily lasting me for a day and almost it was not a very  heavy day about one and a half days.  So definitely the battery life is a huge improvement.  I would say even if you're sort of a heavy user, it will easily last you for a typical  full day.  And that aspect I would say Samsung has done a great job.  Some people have quoted me that they are getting about two days of battery life with"

And the first thing is now, finally like the OnePlus 70 Pro, this also has a 90 Hz display.  The regular ones had 60 Hz."

But the single speaker is actually pretty loud and adequate.  So no issues regarding the loud speaker.  But I missed the fact that it does not have stereo speaker set up.  I also what do you say?  Another thing that I have noticed is that and this will be for music lovers.  If you listen to a lot of music, where the 3.5 headphone jack, the audio output that you  get from the headphone jack is excellent, I would say."

The first thing that I'll immediately like with this device is the build quality and  styling.  The styling is actually really well done on this one.  So it looks like a very stylish phone, especially in this black color as you can see, it"

433,225,Phone,OnePlus 3,OnePlus 3 Long Term Review with 4 months of use,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfMizgMKvEQ,1:25-1:42,os,1.0, a very fluid device.  Now when we talk about the performance of this device here also the OnePlus 3 has excellent  and it's performing brilliantly even after about 4 or months of usage and I have to say  it is one of the most fluid Android phones that I have used and prior to using this again

As you can see, I'm trying to.  I guess this is run G that in this video, let's do the popper unboxing in first look.  Only single speaker as you can see, it can completely block it like this.  There's a popper in the unit.  So as you see, the speaker is adequate, I would say, but I wish it was slightly louder."

I don't know how it looks on the screen but in reality this does not look that elegant  and it looks cheap.  In fact it's a royal fingerprint magnet.  You have to constantly wipe it every 5 minutes otherwise it attracts fingerprints like anything  and guys this is not last.  This is actually plastic.  So they could have done a lot better job.  I felt the real mean 9 pro plus last year had a much better battery back on this one.

And also moving to the rear camera, as you can see, the rear camera just juts out a  little bit.  So again, you got to be careful if you don't use it with a case.  And if you keep it on the desk, actually it's resting on that camera and the phone"

But in terms of RAM management, the RAM management was done very well on this level.  As you can see, I have tons and tons of apps running on this one.  And I simply don't bother about it.  And I just tap those apps.  They just load as you can see.  So I don't have to worry about these.  And RAM management has been done very well on this device.  So you don't have to worry about it."

And the first thing I liked about this device is that 6.4 inch that is a AMOLED screen  that is a full HD plus screen and it is a very good quality screen that we are getting.  And also like the fact that they went with this drop down notch not that punch hole notch  that we are seeing in the higher end devices because I feel this is a lot subtle and you

The build quality of this device is excellent.  It feels really solid in the hand.  It's unlike the Blackberry Prif which I covered about a year ago.  There I was not happy with the build quality but this one is that solid legendary build quality  that we expect from Blackberry.  The build quality is excellent.

And the first thing that I liked with this device is that 6.3 inch screen.  And in fact, if you look at the phone, it is very similar to the Redmi, what do you  say, sorry, the Realme 2 Pro.  In fact, it looks almost identical to that, even the screen size, etc.  This is the Realme 2 Pro and this is the new one.  So it comes with the same 6.3 inch screen, it's a full HD screen, IPS, great screen.  The quality of the screen is really good.  And I like the fact that it doesn't have that big notch or something."
412,220,Phone,Google Pixel XL,Google Pixel XL Smartphone Review Good & The Bad,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYK_NMI2Aeg,8:39-8:59,speaker,0.0, Now moving to the loudspeaker it has just one speaker here at the bottom and it's in a  very odd position I would say and the thing is that it's not very loud.  So it's sort of disappointing in terms of the speaker output in my Frank opinion.  If you're coming from the Nexus 6P the Nexus 6P had far better speaker performance.
164,134,Phone,Honor pLAY ,Honor Play Review with Pros & Cons - The Affordable Flagship,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtQ6fzNOGNg,0:50-1:20,design,1.0," First let's talk about the pros and then we move to the cons section.  And the first thing that I really liked about this device is the build quality.  The build quality is amazing.  It's not the best build quality we have ever seen but for this price fund the base variant  of this device is sold in India that comes with 4GB of RAM for just 20,000 and for that  price I would say the build quality is premium.  It's a block of metal that you get and no flexing or anything."

Now moving to the front facing camera which is a 5 megapixel shooter.  I would say the camera performance is just average.  In outdoor conditions as you can see where we have a lot of lighting the pictures come out  to be really good but in indoor lighting and artificial lighting conditions the pictures  tend to be a little bit soft to my liking when you zoom in as you can see.  So the front facing camera is strictly very average I would say.

",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA2lmfm-kS8,0:54-1:21,design,1.0, Anyways let's talk about it and the first thing that I actually liked about this smartphone  is strangely the in-hand feel.  In-hand feel is actually really good of this handset.  So it's having that 6.55 inch screen it's actually comfortable to hold because that  is also rounded a little bit so it does not feel very big and the biggest thing I would  say is that the way balance has been done well on this one this was always a problem

It acts like six different functions it has.  You can customize it.  For example, I have customized it if I tap it on on a long time, the notification bar just  comes down like this.  You can even actually switch between the apps."

The notch in fact has a front facing flash and as you can see it's not very big. So this  is what you get and it's a good quality full HD plus screen it's IPS great screen. So

The charger that you get in the box is not a fast charger but I tested this device with  the tester using a fast charger and I was surprised that if you use a fast charger this  charger is a certified Qualcomm quick charger too.

But again, I don't like the fact that even in the lowest brightness, the screen is actually  pretty bright.  And this is not an issue for most of the people, but I normally use even my phones at night  and I close all the lights.  And even in the lowest brightness, it's actually pretty bright.  So that is one thing that I'm not happy about."

Xiaomi has really up the build quality with this Redmi Note 4.  It feels very premium for the pricing and it feels great in the hand.  And also it has that 2.5D glass which makes the experience of using this device very

So in outdoor conditions, I felt that the camera performance is actually pretty good. But when you move to indoor lighting conditions like this, this is artificial lighting conditions.  Here I noticed that the saturation level is a little bit on the highest side. And some of the skin tones, for example, these are the sample shots that I've took of myself. They come out actually particularly dark."

I tried it with three different quick charges.  I tested it a lot.  And this device simply as of now does not support quick charging to charge it.  It was around 8% when I tested it.  And to charge it 100%, it took about 2 hours 45 minutes.  So if it's completely dead, it'll take almost 3 hours to completely charge.  So there is no support for quick charging with this device.  So you have to be aware about that."

The build quality is amazing.  It feels very solid to hold like a premium Android phone.  It does not feel cheap when you hold it.  It is a solid phone and also moving to the glass they are using a 2.5D glass which curves

It simply does not feel that heavy and that's important for a smartphone week.  Guys, don't feel like these phones are with us for a long, long time.  The weight balance has been done really well.

And I have tested this one with a lot of headphones.  These are audio technique M40X even M50X the grados.

And I thought the speaker calls would be also very loud but even at max volume the speaker calls were not that loud even at max volume.  I hope Google can actually fix this with a software update because it's a very strange.  Now if you play back music watch videos the speakers are really loud. Also moving to the speaker second thing that I noticed is that ringtone volume even at max volume is not super loud."

This is sort of nitpicking that I am doing.  And this is regarding the face unlock and the iris.  Now actually using a hybrid to do that.  And still I would say it is not as fast as the face unlocking that we find on the iPhone  10.  So that is also minor gride.  But again, you do have that fingerprint scanner.  And this is also a slight gride that I have.  Notice the fingerprint scanner here at the back.  They should have made it slightly bigger in my opinion.  The target location is actually very small.  And also as you can see, I am just holding the phone comfortably.  Still, I am not able to reach my finger.  And so you have to actually stress your finger a little bit."

This is something that I did not like.  Haptic feedback I feel has been reduced a little bit.  Don't get me know that's not bad.  But again, for a flagship costing almost one and a half lakhs, I expected the haptics  to be slightly better and stronger.  That is not the case."

Actually the build quality is really good and as you can see in terms of looks also it  looks actually really good.  It looks far more expensive than what it is.  So in terms of build quality and looks I would say I will give the high marks to Honor  what they have done with this device.

And first the best thing that the Samsung has done is that they went with the Snapdragon 675 SSE on this one and it's a very powerful processor and also a very power efficient processor.

But one con is that it is slightly on the heavier side.  And I even showed it to my cousin who was using the Note 5.  He picked it up.  He liked the phone.  But immediately after about 20 seconds, he said the phone is slightly heavy.  So that is one thing you have to bear with it.  I got used it after three days.

They have actually increased the screen size on this one.  Now this is a 6.4-inch screen that they are having.  Though in terms of what you say, wet and height, it's not that much bigger from the  Note 8.  But again, still, it's a massive screen.  And that is something that you will see.  And I have to say, again, it's one of the best quality screens that you can get.  It's a Super AMOLED.  The best that Samsung has as of now.  So the screen quality is really good and it also supports HDR10.  So again, great screen quality.  Again, in terms of brightness, also if you leave it on auto brightness, no issues even"

Now moving to the battery life it is having a 3800 milli amp hour battery and again like  most modern smartphones it is a sealed battery and I have to say I was really impressed with  the battery life that I was getting on this phone.  Generally it will last for about one and a half days for most users and if you are sort  of a casual user it will last you for about two days.  As you can see from the charge mostly it was lasting over one and a half days and I was  getting screen on time and excess of about 6 to even about 7 hours.  So in terms of battery life Nokia has done excellent optimization and the Snapdragon 660  SOC is also very good.  So in terms of battery life I was actually impressed with this device.

It feels really, really well built like a very premium high end handset."

And I would say the camera performance was very good.  And I've taken a lot of camera samples with this one.  So here are the samples to give you an idea.  So these samples were taken with the ray facing camera.  And as you can see, the pictures came out good.  And also in terms of color reproduction was good.  This was the regular shot."

It's a 6.4-inch AMOLED screen.  But the good thing is that it's a proper full HD plus screen.  Yes, you have that notch.  But again, if you notice, the screen quality is really good on this one.

That is almost 24 hours without any issues.  In my regular usage as I mentioned I was using this device for the last 9 days.

I don't use that Google Assistant that much so if they would have given a button to customize  it that would have been great.  Moving to one more thing that I simply did not like is that the compass sensor is simply

Now regarding the speaker output it just has a single speaker  here at the bottom and I would say the speaker quality is not very loud. So I was disappointed with  the speaker quality and in fact I was when I was taking calls with the speaker phone it was very  low even at max volume. So that is one thing I do not like about this device. It's not terrible

So the first thing that I like is the 6.18 inch screen.  It's not as big as most of the other phones so it's slightly on the compact size these  days most of the phones are having a what do you say 6.3 inch screen or something like  that so they're slightly bigger.  So as you can see this one is slightly on the smaller size so if you don't like very big  phones then it's okay size in my front opinion.

Next thing is regarding the back I've also mentioned about this in my unboxing video.  And guys this is a completely plastic pack and I feel it does not look that premium I  would say and because it's a plastic back I don't know if the camera can capture it.  You're already have got some scratches and nicks.  So again you have to be very careful and Samsung does not even provide a case when the  box.  So if you bind this smartphone put a skin or put a case I would say because this will definitely  get scratches.

I use my testers and I actually tested it with three different quick charges and it simply did  not pull over 5.2 volts. So it simply does not support any quick charging.

The next thing is, if you see this camera hump over here, and it just plays it down, it  wobbles.  So you just can't play it like this and if you are a person who likes to do things like  this, you can't do it.  It's shaky as hell."

In fact the LPDO screen on this one can go as low as 1 hertz and dynamically refresh to  120 hertz.  So battery life it was a big pain point for the Flip 3 has been solved in this one.  In fact if you recall I never recommended the Flip 3 because of battery life but that has

It's having the Snapdragon 675 SOC, which is obviously better than the Snapdragon 660  and the base variant is priced at 14,000."

So if we talk yes it will last for a typical working day if you are sort of average  user to what you say not a heavy user but if you are sort of a heavy user yes you might  have to top it up and again if we compare the battery life with many of the other Android  phones in this price segment then I would say the battery life is not that great on this  LG Q6.

And also now moving to the speaker.  It has a single speaker here at the bottom and it's fine, I would say.

And the first thing that I did not like is, again, it's due to that front facing camera.  That pill shape that you are getting is because of that dual camera setup.  And I frankly feel they shouldn't have gone with this one.  They should have gone with a single camera setup just like the Galaxy S10."

Now I'm going to another thing and this is actually very peculiar.  And I've used a lot of devices with Snapdragon 845 SOC.  This is also having the Snapdragon 845 SOC but with the Pixel 3 XL I'm noticing that even with just normal 5 minutes of usage.  Not using games and stuff like that, a little bit of camera, a little bit of texting and stuff.  Replying to WhatsApp messages and all those things.  The phone, this back portion gets to get a little bit warm with even just about 5 minutes of regular usage.  I don't get me wrong it's nothing like it's getting very hot or something but I do feel the warmth on this phone compared to most other flagships."

But I got used to the weight of this device after about three, four days.  And it's a good quality AMOLED screen that you're having again because it's an AMOLED  screen.  Again, if you notice the viewing angles are good, the blacks are jet black.  So I didn't have a problem with the AMOLED screen.  And also if you keep it on auto brightness, that's how I was using it."

Those are the pros.  And the first thing is the 6.8 inch screen. Yes, it's actually pretty big.  But the highlight thing is the screen. And the quality of the screen that Samsung has put is actually really good on this one.  The colors look very good and it doesn't hurt your eyes even after extended usage.  And the screen quality is really good. It can go actually pretty bright and outdoor lighting.  So one of the best AMOLED screens. But again, in terms of technical specification, it's still a 60Hz screen, not a 90Hz screen."
