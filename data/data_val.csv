Now next thing I really like and I think so this is again a huge improvement on the iPhone  7 is in respect to camera.  The real facing camera now has optical image stabilization and the camera performance has  also increased a lot.  As you can see in the sample shows the pictures that I took casually came out really good.

And the first thing again as it is a Nokia phone that I liked is the build quality.  The build quality is actually really good on this one.  It has the new screen aspect ratio 18s to 9, hence it is having a 6N screen.  It is not a super AMOLED screen, it is an IPS screen but the quality of the screen is  actually really good."

Now moving to the storage and RAM, even the base variant comes with 1.8GB of storage  and 8GB of RAM.  So that's actually a really nice thing."

Don't give me wrong.  It's not like this smartphone cannot handle gaming.  It can handle gaming.  It's because of the tensor associated on this one."

So the Exynos processor handles it fine.  I didn't have any issues also while I was using the phone I even used it outdoors and stuff.  I didn't face any issues of any overheating or something like that.  So in that aspect I did have a problem or what do you say laggyness.  I didn't and I like the fact this comes out of the box with Android 9.  And the new one UI.  So you don't have to worry about it.  And one UI is the new user interface that Samsung is using.

Now moving to another thing that I like with this phone is the earpiece is actually loud  and very clear on this phone so in terms of cellular call quality I never had a problem  it was a very loud and clear.  Now moving to speaker phone also the speaker phone setup is good it's actually having a  stereo speaker so I took a lot of calls with the speaker phone also and they were loud

It's the new Xenos 7904. And this is also an octocore processor.  But generally most of the octocore processor are divided into two parts.  Quadcore, one quadcore part and the other quadcore part.  Generally, one quad-core part is the more powerful one,  and other is the power efficient one. But here, with this Xenos 7904,  what Samsung has done is, instead of having a quad core for the,  what do you say, powerful cores, it's just dual core.  But again, it's a good one. It's the ARM Cortex A73.  These are the powerful dual core ones. And the other six cores are based on the ARM Cortex A53.  And in general usage, I would say, I didn't have any issues of what you say,  major lag that I'm noticed on this device, as you can see.  It still runs on the old Samsung experience UI, not the new one you are.  But for the most part, I would say, I didn't notice any laggingness,  but only place where I did notice some minor lag.  And that's the animation is in the multitasking tray.  I feel it's the animation, but again, I am sort of spoiled because I use a lot of high-end phones.  So I do notice that most of you might not notice that.  So again, in general usage, most of you might not notice like,  only place where I did notice lag was when I was using Google Maps.  And when I was just minimizing it, just notice this drop in animation frames that I was noticing.  This is the only place where I noticed huge animation lag.  Apart from that, for the most part, in general UI and stuff, I didn't notice that much lag."

It's a good quality screen that they have put and I've consumed a lot of multimedia content  on this device and trust me the screen quality is good.  Even in terms of build quality I'm so glad oner didn't go with the glass back.

Any where I would say you can get a screen on time with full day of usage.  You don't have to top it up in the evenings or something like that.  Easily from 5 hours to anywhere to about even 7 hours of SOT you can get on this smartphone.  So in terms of battery life it's actually good.  It's not extraordinary.

And I would say for the 90% of the times, the call quality was very clear and  audible. I did not have a problem.  But again, if you're new to this, we have seen this stuff in very high-end phones earlier.  So it might take a day or two to get used to it."

This comes with a 3000 F110 BLEAM power battery.  And I have to say the battery life on this device is insane.  As you can see from the charts, even when it was off the charger for one and a half days,  I could get a screen on time of about 7 and a half to 9 hours.  So in terms of battery life, I have to say the battery life was nothing short of extraordinary"

I feel in terms of loudness, the iPhone X speakers in stereo mode are definitely louder  than this one.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad.  But again, it's also not as loud as on the iPhone X.  And the iPhone X also has slight depth base.  This is lacking on this one.  Now because Samsung was starting about this phone is the new S Pen."

Again, the Moto Z play, even last year, last year version was good and it did not exhibit  any lagginess while using the device.  And that's the same case even with this one.

Anyways moving to the next thing is regarding the battery life here I was a little bit worried  about the battery life but I'm happy to say that battery life is not an issue and in fact  in terms of battery life very surprisingly both those both these the 7 and the 7 Pro  will give you very similar battery life though this one is having a bigger screen a bigger

Now moving to RAM management I was initially a lot worried with this device because this comes with  just 4GB of RAM there is no variant of 6GB or anything like that and storage is also 64GB this  only one variant that is being sold in India. So I was a little bit skeptical but I'm happy to say  that the RAM management has been done very well on this device and even though just has 4GB of RAM  it handles apps very well and even some apps that have to be in memory like true caller etc

And I was also surprised regarding the RAM management the RAM management on this device  is surprisingly good considering that heavy fun touch over that we have.  So in terms of day to day usage I did not have any issues with this device and it holds  most of the apps also in the RAM so no issues regarding the RAM management.

It has that 4500 milliampar battery and the good thing is that it comes with 25 watt fast  charger in the box.  And in terms of charging, if I recall, it was at 14% and after 1 hour when I looked at  the charger, it was at 90% so 94% actually.  So the charger is really quickly just slightly over 1 hour.

Moving to video, I took some video.  And here are the samples of the video that I took.  Guys, recording this sample with the Galaxy M20's rear facing camera.  And you guys judge how it was the video.  And I'm just walking hand-hired.  So you guys let me know what do you feel about the video recording.  And the audio is also being recorded via its internal microphone.  So this should give you an idea.  How is the video quality with the front facing camera of the Samsung M20 smartphone?  So camera, I would say it's good.  But in video, I don't know why, with the rear facing camera, they did not enable electronic image stabilization.  So let's now move to the cons.  What are the things that really annoyed me on this camera?  And the first thing is that you do the notch design or whatever."

And the first pros that now finally Samsung is con with that you drop down notch design.  Hence the bezels are actually pretty small on this device and they're able to pack in a 6.3-inch screen.  And many of you were actually asking me about the screen quality on this one. I'm happy to say that the screen quality is actually good.  Samsung hasn't compromised on the screen quality. Yes, it's not an AMOLED screen but it is as good as many of the other smartphones in this price range.  In fact, I would say slightly better. So the screen quality is good on this.  Now moving to another thing and I was really surprised is that generally if you have seen other Samsung mid-range phones in the J series and stuff."

I would say it's a slight upgrade to the 920 and if you compare with the Snapdragon this

After some times I noticed that after about 4th or 5th app sometimes if I go to another  app after let us say 10 minutes it reloads it.  So it is aggressively still killing apps a little bit.

And the first thing that you'll notice immediately with this device is this screen aspect  ratio.  It's very different though it's having that 5.5 in screen.  It's in the 18x9 aspect ratio.  Hence it's not very wide even though it's having a 5.5 in screen.  For example, this is the Nokia 6.  This is also having a 5.5 in screen and as you can see it's so wide compared to this  one.
